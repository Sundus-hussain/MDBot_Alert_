# CareNest – Real-Time Child Safety Tracker

CareNest is an AI-powered child safety app designed to track a child’s location in real-time, detect unsafe areas, and send emergency alerts to parents. Built with AWS, Leaflet JS, and Node.js, CareNest uses live data to ensure children are safe when they're outside.
